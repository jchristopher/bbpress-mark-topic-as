bbpress-mark-topic-as
=====================

**Currently in conceptual phase only!**

bbPress extension to allow flagging a Topic as anything you want. The primary inspiration in support forums where many times it's difficult to track down 'related' or 'duplicate' tickets as a customer. Moderators are usually familiar with past tickets though, so they should be able to mark a Topic as a duplicate or related to another Topic. A quick mention on Twitter uncovered that there's an even broader use case, I'd like to explore that more before starting development so as to accommodate as many people as possible.

Initial planning/conversations taking place in [Issues](https://github.com/jchristopher/bbpress-mark-topic-as/issues). All questions/concerns/comments are welcome!
