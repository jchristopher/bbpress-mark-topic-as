bbpress-mark-topic-as
=====================

**Currently in conceptual phase only!**

bbPress extension to allow flagging a Topic as anything you want. The primary inspiration in support forums where many times it's difficult to track down 'related' or 'duplicate' tickets as a customer. Moderators are usually familiar with past tickets though, so they should be able to mark a Topic as a duplicate or related to another Topic. A quick mention on Twitter uncovered that there's an even broader use case, I'd like to explore that more before starting development so as to accommodate as many people as possible.

### Questions

* What does the workflow look like in marking a Topic as someting
* How should the markings be managed?
* What does the relationship look like (e.g. single relationships, one-to-many?)
* When a Topic has been 'marked' what does that look like? bbPress notice style? New Reply to the Topic? Both?
